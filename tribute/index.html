            <p>Nuevos Dolores combines 60's pop and folk with an eclectic mix of genres and influences; but always with its own distinct sound and far from being a mere exercise in retro style.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Jorge Castejo&#769;n (guitarist and founder) moved from Zaragoza to Madrid, and under the name of Nuevos Dolores, he began recording home-produced songs with melodies reminiscent of the 60's and arrangements of spirited organ and synth from his apartment.</p>
            <p>Upon leaving Grupo de Inventores, and releasing various EPs, Nuevos Dolores transformed into a project led principally by Jorge. In June 2019, he released a double single "La Luz/Quizá", that played on Radio 3 and is included on official playlists on Spotify. It is the first of various singles that are included in a self-titled album in 2020: his first appearance on the label Zaragoza Feliz Feliz Records.</p>
            <p>During the second half of 2020, Castejo&#769;n has brought various independent singles to light that are probably his best songs to date.</p>
